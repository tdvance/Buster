## Other info: 

The five songs I made about a decade ago and sat on my hard drive waiting for an excuse to use them are (in the order they occur in the sound loop): Barbershop, Bridge for Sale, Chimley, Gravity, and XTrain.  In addition are two more from FreeSounds or whatever that website was called, Magntron "GameMusic" and Airwolf89 "Epic Battle Music".

Also, sounds from FreeSounds include bottle break, chisel on brick, brick dropped on dirt, golf ball hit, "win" trumpet stab, sad trombone with wah wahs.  Backgrounds come from searching for Urban Decay, and Lego.  The bricks and paddle are home-made in GIMP, and the ball is a golf ball from Google images.

After following the course and building a game, I did what has often worked (but is not recommended for large projects)--I threw away the code (not literally, I kept it around for copy-pasta purposes) and started over from the beginning, incorporating all the "lessons learned" (that's what my management told us to call "screw ups" at work) into the new design.
